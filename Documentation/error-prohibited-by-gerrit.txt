prohibited by Gerrit
====================

This is a general error message that is returned by Gerrit if a push
is not allowed, e.g. because the pushing user has no sufficient
privileges.

In particular this error occurs:

1. if you push a commit for code review to a branch for which you
   don't have upload permissions (access right
   link:access-control.html#category_push_review['Push'] on
   `refs/for/refs/heads/*`)
2. if you bypass code review without
<<<<<<< HEAD   (9e1dcb Merge "Fix link and improve consistency in 'Prohibited by Ge)
   link:access-control.html#category_push_direct['Push'] access right
   on `refs/heads/*`
3. if you push an annotated tag without
   link:access-control.html#category_push_annotated['Push Annotated Tag']
   access right on 'refs/tags/*'
=======
   link:access-control.html#category_push_direct['Push'] privileges
   on `refs/heads/*`
3. if you push a signed or annotated tag without
   link:access-control.html#category_pTAG['Push Tag'] privileges
>>>>>>> BRANCH (5c7718 Merge changes Ifccd40c8,I3fc7a181 into stable)
4. if you push a lightweight tag without the access right link:access-control.html#category_create['Create
   Reference'] for the reference name 'refs/tags/*'

For new users it happens often that they accidentally try to bypass
code review. The push then fails with the error message 'prohibited
by Gerrit' because the project didn't allow to bypass code review.
Bypassing the code review is done by pushing directly to refs/heads/*
(e.g. refs/heads/master) instead of pushing to refs/for/* (e.g.
refs/for/master). Details about how to push commits for code review
are explained link:user-upload.html#push_create[here].
