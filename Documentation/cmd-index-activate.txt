== DESCRIPTION
Gerrit supports online index schema upgrades. When starting Gerrit for the first
time after an upgrade that requires an index schema upgrade, the online indexer
will be started. If the schema upgrade is a success, the new index will be
activated and if it fails, a statement in the logs will be printed with the
number of successfully/failed indexed changes.

This command allows to activate the latest index even if there were some
failures.

The <index> argument controls which secondary index is activated. Currently, the
only supported value is "changes".

== ACCESS
Caller must be a member of the privileged 'Administrators' group.

== SCRIPTING
This command is intended to be used in scripts.
