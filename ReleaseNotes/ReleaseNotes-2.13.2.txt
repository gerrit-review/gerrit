Read project watches from database.
+
Project watches were being read from the git backend by default, but the
migration to git is not yet completed.

* Hooks plugin: Fix incorrect value passed to `--change-url` parameter.
+
The URL was being generated using the change's Change-Id rather than the
change number.

* Check for CLA when creating project config changes from the web UI.
+
If contributor agreements were enabled and required for a project, and
the user had not signed a CLA, it was still possible to upload changes
for review on `refs/meta/config` by making changes in the project access
editor and pressing 'Save for Review'.
