Bug Fixes
---------

* issue 528 gsql: Fix escaping of quotes in JSON
+
JSON output was not properly escaped, due to a bug in the underlying
Gson library.  Fixed by upgrading.

* issue 531 commit-msg: Fix jumbling of URL at end of message
+
URLs at the end of a commit message sometimes caused the Change-Id
to be inserted above the URL, rather than below it.  Fixed, but
users will need to recopy the hook to their local repositories.
