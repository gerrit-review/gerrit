Important Notes
---------------

*WARNING:* There are no schema changes from
link:ReleaseNotes-2.9.3.html[2.9.3], but when upgrading from an existing site
that was initialized with Gerrit version 2.6 to version 2.9.1 the primary key
column order will be updated for some tables. It is therefore important to
upgrade the site with the `init` program, rather than only copying the .war file
over the existing one.

It is recommended to run the `init` program in interactive mode. Warnings will
be suppressed in batch mode.
