The fix for
link:https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3361[Issue 3361]
that was included in Gerrit versions 2.10.7 and 2.11.4 introduced a
regression that prevented more than one file header diff from being
computed at the same time across the entire server.

* Fix `sshd.idleTimeout` setting being ignored.
+
The `sshd.idleTimeout` setting was not being correctly set on the SSHD
backend, causing idle sessions to not time out.

* Add the correct license for AsciiDoctor.
+
AsciiDoctor is licensed under the MIT License, not Apache2 as previously
documented.
